# LEGEND KEYBOARD
A simple 6 by 5 split keyboard with 3 thumb keys and a display.  
It is planned to be made through Ergogen, KiCad and ZMK.  
This not complete yet or fully tested so please do not use yet.

## Features
As meationed before it is 6x5 with thumb keys all multiplied by 2 so 66 keys.  
It uses a Nice!Nano v2 so it has wireless and wired capability.  
Along with the Nice!Nano it has Nice!View for the display.  
The keyboard will include a reset button and a battery slider too.  

## Unusual Elements
Unlike most people I used outlines and combos for the mounting points intead of footprints in pcbs.  
I did this so i could visually see them in ergogen to stop the amount of times i had to switch between Ergogen and KiCad.  
It also has stilts for the pcb to sit on so i have room for the battery and maybe have foam or something to provide a bit more support
